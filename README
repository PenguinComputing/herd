WHAT IS HERD
------------

This is herd (Hardware Error Report and Decode), a correctable
hardware errors monitoring tool for Sun Microsystem Opteron-based Sun
Fire servers. Herd monitors your hardware for various correctable
errors (such as correctable Machine Check Exceptions or MCEs) and
report them both to the system log and to the system Service Processor
(SP) through the system IPMI interface.

Herd is also meant as a replacement to the mcelog utility and is
backward compatible with its syslog reporting format.


BUILDING FROM SVN TREE
----------------------

- run the script 'autogen.sh' to generate the autotools files.

- run 'configure'

- run 'make'

BUILDING FROM A TARBALL
-----------------------

Simply run 'configure', then 'make'.


WHAT'S IN THIS TARBALL
----------------------

Because the Sun Fire Service Processor software (ILOM) uses an IPMIv2
interface to communicate with the host system, herd needs to work with
the OpenIPMI library version >= 2. This tarball contains its own copy
of the low-level libraries of OpenIPMI 2.0.7.
