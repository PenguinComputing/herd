WHAT IS HERD
------------

This is herd (Hardware Error Report and Decode), a correctable
hardware errors monitoring tool for Sun Microsystem and Penguin
Computing Opteron-based servers. Herd monitors your hardware for
various correctable errors (such as correctable Machine Check
Exceptions or MCEs) and report them both to the system log and to
the system Service Processor (SP) through the system IPMI interface.

Herd is also meant as a replacement to the mcelog utility and is
backward compatible with its syslog reporting format.


REGENERATE autotools FILES
--------------------------

Not usually necessary, but if need be, run the script 'autogen.sh'
to generate the autotools files.


BUILDING FROM GIT OR A TARBALL
------------------------------

Simply run 'configure', then 'make'.


WHAT'S IN THIS TARBALL
----------------------

Because the Sun Fire Service Processor software (ILOM) and Penguin
Computing BMCs use an IPMIv2 interface to communicate with the host
system, herd needs to work with the OpenIPMI library version >= 2.
This tarball contains its own copy of the low-level libraries of
OpenIPMI 2.0.7.
